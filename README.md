*WHY OUR DEVICE IS  IMPORTANT ??? 
 
As we have observed in expensive vehicles, 
the sensors detects drowsiness and stops 
the vehicle in the middle of the road or find 
the suitable place to stop the car, in case of 
high population country like india there is 
many factor on a road that canâ€™t be 
detected and in highways if the car stop in 
middle of road  which is dangerous as 
another vehicle may collide with it.  
Therefore, alert system is important to 
make the driver more alert while driving so 
the accidents can be prevent.




Library To Install 
1. OpenCV
2. Dlib
3. Python3 
4. Imutils 
5. Pygame 
6. face_utils 
7. scipy 
9. time 
10. os 
11. pip3 
12. numpy



*Conclusion:

In our model, we apply a logic where the camera continuously track the driver's eyes. If the driver closes their eyes for more than 2 seconds, indicating a state of  drowsiness, or if the driver consistently keeps their eyes open for more than 10 seconds, indicating a state of hypnosis.  If either of the two conditions is true, the system will activate an voice alert message, and a vibration motor will generate haptic feedback on the steering. With the help of this mechanism ,the driver willl snap out from hypnosis or drowsinees state ,overall it will  heightened awareness and it will create a safer environment for driver ,passsenger and the family.
